                                    Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business
                                    activities, providing customer service, and making available other products and services
                                    to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information

                                    offers we think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you product and service
                                    offers are developed and managed under our traditional corporate standards designed to
                                    safeguard the security and privacy of our customers personal information. You are
                                    allowed at any time to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers whether collected

                                    Cookies are a feature of the web browser software that allows web servers to recognize
                                    the computer used to access a website. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored
                                    by a user&apos;s web browser on the user&apos;s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information
                                    a user accesses on one web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by
                                    the same user or to use the information to streamline the user&apos;s transactions on related
                                    web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from web page to web page and to

                                    When you send confidential personal credit card information to us on our website, a secure server

                                    Other e-mails that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security
                                    measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we
